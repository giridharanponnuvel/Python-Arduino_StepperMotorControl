Purpose:This code is developed to control 3 stepper motor simultaneously in a delta robot. This code receive a string from the python. The python will send a string like this 52a34b67c? where 52 is the number of steps to be turned by Motor A, 34 is the no.of steps to be turned by Motor B. Similarly, 67 for Motor C. After Arduino receiving the string, it will process it and send signal to the 3 stepper motor drivers.
